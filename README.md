# Bellabeat Case Study 🧘‍♀️📊

This project is part of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics).

## 📌 Objective

Analyze smart device usage data (Fitbit) to understand user behavior and provide insights that could help Bellabeat grow their user base and improve engagement.

## 🔍 Dataset

The dataset used comes from 30 Fitbit users who consented to share their personal tracker data via Kaggle.

## 🧪 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Seaborn & Matplotlib for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Insights

- Users are most active at 12 PM and 6 PM
- Strong correlation between time in bed and time asleep
- Weight tracking is highly underutilized
- Sedentary time does not vary significantly between user activity levels

## 🧠 Recommendations

- Encourage better sleep habits with personalized notifications
- Promote the weight tracking feature with automation or tips
- Highlight peak activity hours to tailor fitness content

## 🛠 Limitations

- Small sample size
- Self-reported and potentially inconsistent data
- No confirmation of proper device usage
